Project: Dynamic Weather App using Openweather API

First of All, I created the react app , weather using the command npm create-react-app weather then 
all the assets are gathered like photos. then i wrote the html part including a form for taking input data as city name then 
created  the different parameters of weather prediction in the html file and after that i styled the html with css 
then i also imorted some react-icons for styling the page. After doing all these things, i went to openweatherapi website and
generated my api id , after that in the WeatherService.js file , i used a aync function and inside that the api call link was pasted
and api data is fetched  using await fetch()

In this way The weather app is created

but there is still a problem the city name when passed as input then the site is not updated with the new city details
